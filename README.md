# Phoenix OS

An agentic framework for spec-driven development that transforms AI copilots from non-deterministic to deterministic behavior for enterprise-grade code generation.

## The Problem

AI coding assistants produce non-deterministic outputs—the same prompt yields different results each time. For enterprises, this means:
- Code developers don't understand
- Systems that can't be debugged
- Technical debt that compounds

## The Solution

Phoenix OS is an **operating system for AI-powered development**. Like an OS orchestrates hardware resources, Phoenix OS orchestrates AI agents through cognitive flows to deliver quality, consistent code.

### Core Flow

```
Signal → Recipe → Sub-Agent(s) → Skill(s) → Execute
                       ↓
                 Read Memory (STM + LTM)
                       ↓
                 Build Context → Output
```

### AI-Native SDLC

```
DISCOVER ──► SPECIFY ──► DESIGN ──► BUILD ──► RUN
```

## Three Tenets

1. **Intent-Driven, Tool-Agnostic Execution** - Focus on outcomes, adapt to available tools
2. **Context-Aware Decision Making** - Adapt behavior based on environment and context
3. **Built as an Agentic System** - Autonomous agents collaborate to deliver deterministic outcomes

## Core Components

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Signals** | Perception layer - user prompts, schedules, webhooks |
| **Recipes** | Pre-defined workflows through SDLC steps |
| **Sub-Agents** | Autonomous Keepers that steward domains |
| **Skills** | Bounded, deterministic capabilities |
| **Memory** | Organizational brain - STM (session) + LTM (persistent) |

## Agent Types

- **System Keepers** (`{area}-keeper`) - project-keeper, repo-keeper, deploy-keeper
- **SDLC Roles** - developer, tech-lead, architect, validator
- **Specialists** (`{domain}-{action}er`) - bug-analyzer, code-reviewer
- **High-Order** (`{domain}-guardian`) - standards-guardian, pattern-alchemist

## Philosophy

- [Philosophy](philosophy/philosophy.md) - Fluidic SDLC and core tenets
- [Principles](philosophy/principles.md) - Design principles and component specs
- [Naming Conventions](philosophy/naming-conventions.md) - Standards for recipes, agents, skills
