## Loaded Signals

### Signal 1: AI Augmentation Principle
**Source**: @{user-vault}/signals/ai/augmentation-principle.md
**Content**:
AI should augment human capabilities, not replace human judgment for critical decisions. The most successful AI implementations enhance what humans do well (creativity, empathy, complex reasoning) while automating what machines do well (pattern matching, scale, consistency).

**Implications**:
- AI projects should start with "what human capability are we augmenting?"
- Avoid AI-for-AI's-sake projects that don't connect to human workflows
- Success metric: humans become more effective, not obsolete

### Signal 2: PCAM Framework
**Source**: @{user-vault}/signals/ai/pcam-framework.md
**Content**:
Four dimensions define agentic AI systems:
1. **Perception** — What signals can it sense?
2. **Cognition** — How does it reason?
3. **Agency** — What actions can it take?
4. **Manifestation** — What outputs does it produce?

**Implications**:
- Use PCAM to evaluate any "AI-powered" proposal
- Weak in any dimension = weak overall system
- Most "AI features" are perception-only (no real agency)
