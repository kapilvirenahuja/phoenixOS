# Flywheel Protocol

> Mental model for building sustainable momentum

## Overview

The Flywheel is a mental model for creating compounding momentum through consistent, deliberate action. Unlike linear progress, a flywheel builds energy over time—each rotation makes the next one easier.

## Core Principles

### 1. Customer Zero

**Concept**: Be your own first customer. Use what you build before anyone else does.

**Why it matters**:
- Reveals friction and pain points firsthand
- Creates authentic feedback loops
- Builds deep product intuition
- Demonstrates conviction

**In practice**:
- Use your own tools daily
- Document your own experience
- Fix what frustrates you first
- Share genuine lessons learned

---

### 2. Daily Accountability

**Concept**: Small, consistent actions compound into significant results.

**Why it matters**:
- Builds habits stronger than motivation
- Creates visible progress
- Enables course correction
- Maintains momentum through uncertainty

**In practice**:
- Define daily non-negotiables
- Track progress visibly
- Celebrate small wins
- Learn from missed days without guilt

---

### 3. Momentum Building

**Concept**: Each action should make the next action easier or more valuable.

**Why it matters**:
- Creates compounding returns
- Reduces activation energy over time
- Builds defensible advantages
- Enables sustainable pace

**In practice**:
- Identify reinforcing loops
- Invest in force multipliers
- Remove recurring friction
- Document and systematize

## The Flywheel Stages

```
        ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
        │                                     │
        ▼                                     │
   ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐ │
   │  BUILD  │───►│  SHARE  │───►│  LEARN  │─┘
   └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘
        ▲                             │
        │                             │
        └─────────────────────────────┘
              (each cycle easier)
```

### Stage 1: Build
Create something valuable, even if small. Ship it.

### Stage 2: Share
Put it in front of others. Get real feedback.

### Stage 3: Learn
Absorb insights. Identify what worked and what didn't.

### Stage 4: Repeat
Apply learnings. Build the next iteration.

## Flywheel Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Big Bang Launches** | All-or-nothing bets | Ship incrementally |
| **Perfection Paralysis** | Waiting until "ready" | Ship when "good enough" |
| **Vanity Metrics** | Measuring what doesn't matter | Focus on actionable metrics |
| **Isolated Building** | No feedback loops | Share early and often |
| **Burnout Sprints** | Unsustainable intensity | Sustainable daily pace |

## Applying Flywheel to Phoenix OS

| Phoenix Component | Flywheel Application |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Recipes** | Repeatable workflows that compound knowledge |
| **Memory (LTM)** | Accumulated wisdom that makes future work easier |
| **Skills** | Reusable capabilities that reduce friction |
| **Signals** | Feedback loops that inform improvement |

---

## Key Questions

1. What daily action, done consistently, would create the most momentum?
2. Where is friction slowing down the flywheel?
3. What reinforcing loop is not yet established?
4. Am I using what I'm building (Customer Zero)?
5. What small win can I ship today?
