```

### Radar Review Cadence

| Cadence | Activity |
|---------|----------|
| **Daily** | Capture signals as they emerge |
| **Weekly** | Review and categorize signals |
| **Monthly** | Identify patterns across radars |
| **Quarterly** | Strategic implications and actions |

---

## Radar Interactions

Signals often span multiple radars. Common intersections:

| Intersection | Example |
