description: Initialize Short-Term Memory workspace for recipe execution. Use at the start of any Level 2+ recipe to boot the STM workspace, scan query against radars, and populate context with matched signals. This is always Step 0 of composed workflows.
---

# Initialize STM

Boot the Short-Term Memory workspace and populate it with relevant Vault content via radar scanning.

## When to Use

- **Always**: First step of every Level 2+ recipe
- **Once**: Only invoked once per recipe execution
- **By**: Recipe (not agents)

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `recipe_id` | Yes | Identifier for the recipe being executed |
| `signal` | Yes | The incoming signal (query, source, metadata) |
| `user_context` | No | Known user information (role, history, preferences) |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create Workspace Structure

Create the STM workspace at `.phoenix-os/stm/{recipe-id}-{timestamp}/`:

```
.phoenix-os/stm/{recipe-id}-{timestamp}/
├── state.md           # Current execution state
├── context.md         # Matched signals from Vault
├── intents.md         # Active intent(s)
├── outputs/           # Outputs from each step
└── evidence/          # Supporting artifacts
```

---

### Step 2: Scan Query Against Radars

#### 2a: Semantic Radar Matching

**Invoke skill**: `phoenix-vault-analyze-query-semantics`

```
Input:
  - query: {user's raw query}
  - radars_path: {user-vault}/radars/

Output:
  - direct_matches: [radars with relevance >= 0.6]
  - peripheral_matches: [radars with relevance 0.3-0.59]
  - no_matches: [radars with relevance < 0.3]
  - no_radar_match: boolean
```

This replaces keyword matching with LLM-based semantic analysis. The skill evaluates each radar's **Focus** and **Questions** against the query to determine semantic relevance.

**Match Classification:**
- **Direct match** (relevance >= 0.6): Load all signals from this radar
- **Peripheral match** (relevance 0.3-0.59): Include in graph traversal
- **No match** (relevance < 0.3): Exclude unless reached via graph traversal

#### 2b: Load Signals from Direct Matches

For each radar in `direct_matches`:

1. Read the radar file's `Signal Mappings` table
2. Load each mapped signal file from `{user-vault}/signals/`
3. Extract full signal content for STM
4. Track which radars each signal belongs to (for graph traversal)

```
loaded_radars = set()
loaded_signals = set()
signal_to_radars = {}  # signal_path → [radar1, radar2, ...]

for radar in direct_matches:
    loaded_radars.add(radar.name)
    for signal_path in radar.signal_mappings:
        signal_content = read_signal(signal_path)
        loaded_signals.add(signal_path)
        signal_to_radars[signal_path] = get_radars_for_signal(signal_path)
```

#### 2c: Graph Traversal for Related Signals

**Purpose**: Discover additional relevant context by following signal relationships across radars.

**Algorithm**: Breadth-first traversal with depth limit

```
MAX_DEPTH = 3
current_depth = 1

while current_depth <= MAX_DEPTH:
    new_radars_to_explore = set()

    # For each loaded signal, find other radars that reference it
    for signal_path in loaded_signals:
        for radar_name in signal_to_radars[signal_path]:
            if radar_name not in loaded_radars:
                new_radars_to_explore.add(radar_name)

    # Load signals from newly discovered radars
    for radar_name in new_radars_to_explore:
        radar = read_radar(radar_name)
        loaded_radars.add(radar_name)

        for signal_path in radar.signal_mappings:
            if signal_path not in loaded_signals:
                signal_content = read_signal(signal_path)
                loaded_signals.add(signal_path)
                signal_to_radars[signal_path] = get_radars_for_signal(signal_path)

    # Stop if no new radars discovered
    if len(new_radars_to_explore) == 0:
        break

    current_depth += 1
```

**Example Traversal:**

```
Query: "Help me build something AI-powered"

Depth 0: Semantic analysis
  → Direct: AI/Intelligence (0.9), Innovation (0.7)
  → Peripheral: Purpose (0.5), Technology (0.4)

Depth 1: Load signals from AI/Intelligence, Innovation
  → 18 signals loaded
  → augmentation-principle.md → also in Leadership, Purpose
  → pcam-framework.md → also in Architecture
  → v-bounce-model.md → also in Innovation (already loaded)

Depth 2: Load signals from Leadership, Purpose, Architecture
  → 15 more signals loaded
  → flywheel.md → also in Purpose (already loaded)
  → composability.md → also in Architecture (already loaded)

Depth 3: No new radars discovered
  → Stop traversal

Result: 6 radars explored, 33 signals loaded
```

#### 2d: Classify Match Types for Reporting

After graph traversal, classify radars for context.md:

```
For each loaded radar:
  If radar in direct_matches:
    → type: "direct"
    → confidence: semantic_relevance_score
    → trigger: matched_aspects
  Else if radar in peripheral_matches:
    → type: "peripheral"
    → confidence: 0.4
    → trigger: "semantic relevance" + matched_aspects
  Else:
    → type: "graph_traversal"
    → confidence: 0.3
    → trigger: "discovered via signal: {signal_name}"
```

#### 2e: No Match Handling

```
If semantic analysis returned no_radar_match == true:
  → Set flag: no_radar_match = true
  → This will trigger clarify intent
  → Skip graph traversal (no starting point)
```

**Confidence**: null
**Sequence**: null

---

## Radar Context for Intent Detection

**Direct matched radars**: {list}
**Peripheral matched radars**: {list}
